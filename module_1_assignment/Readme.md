# Module 1 Assignment: Introduction to OOP Concepts in C++ for Robotics

## Implementation:

### Task 1::

- **Create a namespace that will encapsulate different types of robots.**
- **Create two simple classes, one for a Slow Robot and one for a fast one.**
- **Declare all its attributes as variables in the private variable scope with their respective data type.**
- **Write the builder function and then the class methods.**
- **write a main function and create instenses of the robot class without forgetting about the namespace and class attributes and call the class methods.**

### Task 2::

- **Like Task 1 but much simpler since there is no need for a namespace.**

### Task 3::

- **Much more complex than the previous ones, start by adding a header file to the include directory, declaring a namespace for Sensors.**
- **Declare a template for the attribute variable of each sensor class, and implement the interface of the builder function and class methods.**
- **Now create a source file containing the implementation of the class, builder function and methods.**
- **Create a main function where you plug different data types into the template, here char, string and int.**
